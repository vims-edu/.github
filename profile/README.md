## About VIMS
### Science for the Bay, Impact for the World

The Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) has a three-part mission to conduct research in coastal ocean and estuarine science, educate students and citizens, and provide advisory service to policy makers, industry, and the public. VIMS provides these services to Virginia, the nation, and the world. Chartered in 1940, VIMS is currently among the largest marine research and education centers in the United States.

### Graduate Education
The [School of Marine Science (SMS)](https://vims.edu/education/graduate/index.php) at VIMS is the graduate school in marine science for [William & Mary](http://www.wm.edu/). It offers outstanding education and research opportunities for students who seek advanced careers in academia, government, or the private sector.
